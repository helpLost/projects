## Rising Dawns: Adventure
An incremental clicker civilization-builder run entirely in the browser.

### About
RDA is a browser civilization builder about conquering the earth. You start as a recently divinised leader of an unnamed tribe in 4,500 BC, and as time progresses you will unlock more technologies and buildings that will help you on your journey to world domination.

Enemies will try to stop you at every turn, but persistence will win the game for you in the end.

Enjoy!

### Installation
If you want to use the RDA source code, it is totally okay and completely legal, except for the exceptions specified in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file. To download the source code, either download a zip file of the Github repo directly (be warned that the current repository code may not be working!) or one of the editions from the 'releases' section.
>
Once installed, the RDA source files are only usable if you have a home server. I suggest that if you don't have a physical server, use the [Live Preview Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) or the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). They're easy to use and launch directly from VSCode with no setup involved past extension installation.

When the files are ready, open the "index.html" or "creator.html" file with whatever server you have and you should be all good. If you have any problems, do not hesitate to contact me via my email or the "issues" tab of the Github repository.
